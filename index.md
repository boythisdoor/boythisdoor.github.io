#### About  
I received the B.S. degree in Physics from Peking University <img src="fig/pku.png" width="30"/>, Beijing, China, in 2015, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical Engineering from University of California, Los Angeles <img src="fig/logo-ucla.png" width="55"/>, in 2017 and 2020, respectively. I was advised by [Dr. Asad A. Abidi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=44y2Oc4AAAAJ&hl=en) at UCLA. 
\
I have been with Broadcom Corp. since 2020, working on wireless communication IC design and research.
\
My researches and works focus on radio frequency, mixed-signal, analog, and microwave integrated circuit design.
